    The internet of things helps people live and work smarter, as well as gain complete control over their lives. In addition to offering smart devices to automate homes, IoT is essential to business. IoT provides businesses with a real-time look into how their systems really work, delivering insights into everything from the performance of machines to supply chain and logistics operations.

Pros and cons of IoT
Some of the advantages of IoT include the following:

 <li>ability to access information from anywhere at any time on any device;</li>
 <li>improved communication between connected electronic devices</li>
 <li>transferring data packets over a connected network saving time and money;</li>
 <li>automating tasks helping to improve the quality of a business's services and reducing the need for human intervention</li>
 <li>As the number of connected devices increases and more information is shared between devices, the potential that a hacker could steal confidential information also increases.</li>
 <li>Enterprises may eventually have to deal with massive numbers -- maybe even millions -- of IoT devices, and collecting and managing the data from all those devices will be challenging.</li>
 <li>Since there's no international standard of compatibility for IoT, it's difficult for devices from different manufacturers to communicate with each other.</li>
<li>If there's a bug in the system, it's likely that every connected device will become corrupted.</li>
